"I only eat the most organic quinoa. Anything else is trash. #healthy #organic"

I essentially made a really obnoxious hipster. That person who can't stand Starbucks as it's too mainstream.
Or dislikes a pretty good band because they sold out. You may not know someone like this, but this hipster
trend seems to everywhere in our media. Silly trends like "hipster glasses" have shown up on the faces of
celebrities and now our faces as well. Just like the 90's nerd has become today's hipster.
 
While standing back and looking at the definition of a hipster, it's easy to see that the whole fad is
ridiculous. I made this bot to satire this fad. It asks thoughtful questions such as "Does anyone know
if I can compost my flannel shirt?" and will insult you if you do not who the band "High-res Bachelor" is.
As a bonus, it also looks for tweets where people mention that they are hipsters, and tells them that they
aren't.
